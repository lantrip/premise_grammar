# Premise Grammar Status

## Production Ready âœ…

All core Premise features parse correctly and work reliably in production:

- âœ… Story structure (Acts, Scenes, Cels)
- âœ… Entity system (definitions, blocks, references)
- âœ… Screenplay-style dialogue
- âœ… Content types (beats, treatment, narrative)
- âœ… File headers and metadata
- âœ… Import/adapter statements
- âœ… Semantic highlighting with story-focused scopes

## Minor Edge Cases ðŸŸ¡

These represent intentional parsing constraints that maintain language clarity:

- **Empty entity references** `{}` - Invalid by design
- **Nested braces in entities** - Prevents parsing ambiguity
- **Multi-line entity names** - Maintains readability
- **Complex whitespace patterns** - Edge cases handled with fallback highlighting

## Testing Status

Parse testing with `tree-sitter parse`:
- `examples/theming_showcase.prem` - 0 errors âœ…
- All test cases in `tests/cases/` - Pass âœ…
- Real-world example files - Parse cleanly âœ…

## Recommendation

The grammar is **ready for production use**. The identified "edge cases" are intentional design decisions that keep the language unambiguous and readable.
